// 1. In order to keep track of user balances, we need to associate a user’s address with the balance that they have.
// a) What is the best data structure to hold this association ?
// b) Using your choice of data structure, set up a variable called balance to keep track of the number of volcano coins that a user has.
// 2. We want to allow the balance variable to be read from the contract, there are 2 ways to do this.
// a) What are those ways ?
// b) Use one of the ways to make your balances variable visible to users of the contract.
// 3. Now change the constructor, to give all of the total supply to the owner of the contract.
// 4. Now add a public function called transfer to allow a user to transfer their tokens to another address.
// This function should have 2 parameters :
// the amount to transfer and the recipient address.
// a) Why do we not need the sender’s address here ?
// b) What would be the implication of having the sender’s address as a parameter ?
// 5. Add an event to the transfer function to indicate that a transfer has taken place, it should record the amount and the recipient address.
// 6. We want to keep a record for each user’s transfers. Create a struct called Payment that can be used to hold the transfer amount and the recipient’s address.
// 7. We want to reference a payments array to each user sending the payment. Create a mapping which returns an array of Payment structs when given this user’s address.
